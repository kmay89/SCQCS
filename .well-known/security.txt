# SCQCS Security Stance
# ---
# This site is static documentation only. It does not process user data,
# store credentials, or execute server-side code. The SCQCS framework
# itself defines security patterns - implementations are separate.
#
# If you discover a security issue with this documentation site or
# have concerns about the framework documentation, we want to hear
# about it. Contact channels are being established.
#
# We practice what we preach: transparency, accountability, and
# minimal attack surface.
