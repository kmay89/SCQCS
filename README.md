## Welcome!

You just found the easiest way to launch a secure, privacy-respecting website.

Whether you're building a portfolio, a product page, or documentation — this template gives you everything the pros use, without needing to be one.

**No tracking. No cookies. No surveillance.** Just clean, fast, secure.

## Your First Secure Website in 5 Minutes

You don't need to understand security headers or cryptographic policies. We've done that work for you. Just follow these steps:

### Step 1: Copy This Template

Click the green **"Use this template"** button at the top of this page, or:

```
Fork → Your own copy → Ready to customize
```

### Step 2: Connect to Netlify (Free)

1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com) and sign up (free)
2. Click **"Add new site"** → **"Import an existing project"**
3. Connect your GitHub account
4. Select your forked SCQCS repository
5. Click **"Deploy"**

That's it. Your site is live with HTTPS, CDN, and security headers — automatically.

### Step 3: Make It Yours

Replace `index.html` with your content. The security stays intact.

**Quick customizations:**
- Change `scqcs.com` to your domain in all files
- Update `security.txt` with your contact info
- Adjust colors in the CSS to match your brand

### Step 4: Celebrate

You just deployed a website more secure than 90% of the internet.

## The Philosophy

SCQCS stands for **Schrödinger's Cat Quantum Cryptography & Security**.

It's a metaphor, not quantum computing. The idea: data should remain sealed until deliberately observed — and observation should leave evidence.

### Three Patterns

1. **Append-only logging** — Events chain forward. History becomes verifiable.
2. **Sealed storage** — Encrypted at rest with minimal metadata.
3. **Accountable access** — Emergency access that leaves receipts.

### Six Principles

| Principle | What It Means |
|-----------|---------------|
| Witness, not watcher | Support evidence without enabling surveillance |
| Audit over trust | Cryptographic proofs outlast policies |
| Exceptions leave fingerprints | Every emergency access is remembered |
| Plan for rotation | Build migration paths from day one |
| Local-first when possible | Minimize external dependencies |
| Design for distrust | Make misuse architecturally difficult |
