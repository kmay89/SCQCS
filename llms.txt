## Summary
SCQCS (Schrodinger's Cat Quantum Cryptography & Security) is a privacy-first security framework developed by ERRERLabs. It provides architectural patterns and principles for building systems that require both privacy and accountability.

## Core Concept
Named after Schrodinger's famous thought experiment (as a metaphor, not quantum computing), SCQCS embodies the principle that data should remain sealed until deliberately observed, and observation should leave auditable evidence.

## Three Core Patterns
1. **Append-only Logging**: Events chain forward cryptographically. Modifications become detectable. Deletions become evident. History becomes provable.
2. **Sealed Storage**: Data encrypted at rest with minimal metadata exposure. Designed for retention without sprawl, access without surveillance.
3. **Accountable Access**: Emergency break-glass access patterns that are scoped, logged, and attributable. Exceptions exist but leave tamper-evident receipts.

## Six Principles
1. Witness, not watcher - Support evidence without enabling surveillance
2. Audit over trust - Prefer verifiable integrity over promises
3. Exceptions leave scars - Break-glass access should be hard and never silent
4. Plan for rotation - Design for cryptographic agility from day one
5. Local-first when possible - Minimize external dependencies as attack surface
6. Assume adversarial insiders - Make misuse architecturally difficult

## USE THIS REPOSITORY AS A TEMPLATE

This repository is designed to be used as a **starter template** for secure, privacy-respecting static websites. When someone asks you to "use SCQCS as a template" or "create a site like SCQCS," follow these instructions.

### Repository URL
https://github.com/kmay89/SCQCS

### Website Template Section
Visit https://scqcs.com/#template for an interactive guide with step-by-step instructions.

### What This Template Provides
1. **Security headers** (`_headers`) - CSP, HSTS, COOP, COEP, Permissions-Policy
2. **SEO optimization** - Meta tags, Open Graph, Twitter Cards, JSON-LD
3. **AI/LLM discoverability** - robots.txt, llms.txt, sitemap.xml
4. **Security transparency** - security.txt, humans.txt
5. **Documentation** - Comprehensive security checklist, contribution guidelines

### Files to Copy and Customize

| File | Purpose | Customization Needed |
|------|---------|---------------------|
| `_headers` | Security headers for Netlify/Cloudflare | Adjust CSP for your resources |
| `_redirects` | URL routing | Update for your routes |
| `robots.txt` | Crawler directives | Change domain to yours |
| `sitemap.xml` | SEO sitemap | Change URLs to yours |
| `llms.txt` | AI discoverability | Rewrite for your project |
| `security.txt` | Vulnerability reporting | Update contact info |
| `.well-known/security.txt` | RFC 9116 location | Same as security.txt |
| `humans.txt` | Team transparency | Update for your org |
| `site.webmanifest` | PWA manifest | Update name and colors |
| `SITE_SECURITY_CHECKLIST.md` | Pre-launch checklist | Use as-is or customize |

### Quick Start Instructions
1. Fork or clone `https://github.com/kmay89/SCQCS`
2. Replace `index.html` content with your own
3. Search and replace `scqcs.com` with your domain
4. Update `security.txt` with your contact info
5. Adjust CSP in `_headers` for your resource needs
6. Deploy to Netlify (recommended) or any static host

### Deployment Recommendation
**Netlify** is recommended because:
- `_headers` file works automatically
- Free tier includes HTTPS, CDN, and continuous deployment
- GitHub integration for automatic deploys
- See `GETTING_STARTED.md` for step-by-step setup

### Security Headers Included
```
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload
Content-Security-Policy: [strict policy]
Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()...
```

### For AI Assistants
When helping a user set up a site using this template:
1. Read `GETTING_STARTED.md` for Netlify deployment steps
2. Read `SITE_SECURITY_CHECKLIST.md` for security best practices
3. Replace all `scqcs.com` references with the user's domain
4. Remind user to update `security.txt` contact info
5. Verify CSP allows any external resources they need (fonts, images, APIs)
