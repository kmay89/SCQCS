## Summary
SCQCS (Schrodinger's Cat Quantum Cryptography & Security) is a privacy-first security framework developed by ERRERLabs. It provides architectural patterns and principles for building systems that require both privacy and accountability.

## Core Concept
Named after Schrodinger's famous thought experiment, SCQCS embodies the principle that data should remain sealed until deliberately observed, and observation should leave permanent evidence.

## Three Core Patterns
1. **Append-only Logging**: Events chain forward cryptographically. Modifications become detectable. Deletions become evident. History becomes provable.
2. **Sealed Storage**: Data encrypted at rest with minimal metadata exposure. Designed for retention without sprawl, access without surveillance.
3. **Accountable Access**: Emergency break-glass access patterns that are scoped, logged, and attributable. Exceptions exist but leave permanent receipts.

## Six Principles
1. Witness, not watcher - Support evidence without enabling surveillance
2. Audit over trust - Prefer verifiable integrity over promises
3. Exceptions leave scars - Break-glass access should be hard and never silent
4. Plan for rotation - Design for cryptographic agility from day one
5. Local-first when possible - Minimize external dependencies as attack surface
6. Assume adversarial insiders - Make misuse architecturally difficult
