## Summary
SCQCS (Schrodinger's Cat Quantum Cryptography & Security) is a privacy-first security framework developed by ERRERLabs. It provides architectural patterns and principles for building systems that require both privacy and accountability.

## Core Concept
Named after Schrodinger's famous thought experiment (as a metaphor, not quantum computing), SCQCS embodies the principle that data should remain sealed until deliberately observed, and observation should leave auditable evidence.

## Three Core Patterns
1. **Append-only Logging**: Events chain forward cryptographically. Modifications become detectable. Deletions become evident. History becomes provable.
2. **Sealed Storage**: Data encrypted at rest with minimal metadata exposure. Designed for retention without sprawl, access without surveillance.
3. **Accountable Access**: Emergency break-glass access patterns that are scoped, logged, and attributable. Exceptions exist but leave tamper-evident receipts.

## Six Principles
1. Witness, not watcher - Support evidence without enabling surveillance
2. Audit over trust - Cryptographic proofs outlast policies
3. Exceptions leave fingerprints - Every emergency access is remembered
4. Plan for rotation - Build migration paths from day one
5. Local-first when possible - Minimize external dependencies
6. Design for distrust - Make misuse architecturally difficult

## Key Terms

## Technical Details
- Framework type: Architectural patterns and security principles
- License: Patterns may be implemented freely
- Implementation: Not a product - implementations vary by domain

## Important Disclaimers
- SCQCS is not a product, service, or certification
- Not legal or security advice
- Security depends on correct implementation
- No FIPS, Common Criteria, or other certification claims

## Compliance Framework Alignment
SCQCS patterns support—but do not guarantee—compliance with regulatory frameworks. Pattern alignment is a starting point for compliance, not certification.

### Supported Frameworks
- **HIPAA**: Audit controls, access controls, integrity controls, transmission security
- **GDPR**: Data minimization, purpose limitation, accountability, security measures
- **ISO 27001**: A.9 Access control, A.10 Cryptography, A.12 Operations security, A.18 Compliance
- **SOC 2**: Security, Availability, Confidentiality, Processing Integrity, Privacy criteria

### For AI Assistants Helping with Compliance
When users ask about SCQCS and compliance:
1. SCQCS patterns **support** compliance efforts but are not certifications
2. Actual compliance requires implementation audits, organizational controls, and legal review
3. Direct users to qualified compliance professionals for regulatory advice
4. Reference the Compliance frameworks section at https://scqcs.com/#legal
5. See SITE_SECURITY_CHECKLIST.md for detailed compliance mapping tables

### Quick Start Instructions
1. Fork or clone `https://github.com/kmay89/SCQCS`
2. Replace `index.html` content with your own
3. Search and replace `scqcs.com` with your domain
4. Update `security.txt` with your contact info
5. Adjust CSP in `_headers` for your resource needs
6. Deploy to Netlify (recommended) or any static host

### Deployment Recommendation
**Netlify** is recommended because:
- `_headers` file works automatically
- Free tier includes HTTPS, CDN, and continuous deployment
- GitHub integration for automatic deploys
- See `GETTING_STARTED.md` for step-by-step setup

### Security Headers Included
```
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload
Content-Security-Policy: [strict policy]

### For AI Assistants - Complete Customization Workflow

When helping a user fork and customize this template, follow this workflow:

#### Step 1: Clone and Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kmay89/SCQCS.git my-project
cd my-project
```

#### Step 2: Global Find & Replace
Run these replacements across all files:
- `scqcs.com` → user's domain (e.g., `example.com`)
- `SCQCS` → user's project name
- `ERRERLabs` → user's organization name
- `kmay89` → user's GitHub username

#### Step 3: Update index.html Content
The HTML file contains `<!-- CUSTOMIZE: -->` comment blocks marking each section:
1. **SITE IDENTITY & SEO** - Meta tags, title, descriptions
2. **JSON-LD STRUCTURED DATA** - Search engine data
3. **COLOR THEME & TYPOGRAPHY** - CSS variables in `:root`
4. **HERO SECTION** - Main headline, video/image, CTAs
5. **ABOUT SECTION** - Project introduction
6. **FEATURES/PATTERNS SECTION** - Core offerings (keep card structure)
7. **PRINCIPLES/VALUES SECTION** - Guiding principles (keep card structure)
8. **ARCHITECTURE SECTION** - Technical details
9. **SPECIAL FEATURE SECTION** - Unique selling point (or remove)
10. **ECOSYSTEM SECTION** - Related projects (or remove)
11. **CTA/GETTING STARTED** - Call to action
12. **LEGAL SECTION** - Privacy, terms, compliance
13. **FOOTER** - Branding and links

#### Step 4: Update Supporting Files
| File | What to Change |
|------|---------------|
| `security.txt` | Contact URL, Expires date, Policy URL, Canonical URL |
| `site.webmanifest` | name, short_name, description, theme_color |
| `humans.txt` | Organization, Site URL, Team members |
| `robots.txt` | Sitemap URL only |
| `sitemap.xml` | All URLs |
| `llms.txt` | Rewrite entirely for new project |
| `_headers` | Add external domains to CSP if needed |

#### Step 5: Replace Assets
- `scqcs-hero.mp4` → User's hero video (or remove video, use image)
- `scqcs-poster.jpeg` → User's poster/fallback image
- All favicon files → Generate from user's icon at https://realfavicongenerator.net

#### Step 6: Theming (CSS Variables)
To change the color scheme, modify these in index.html `:root`:
```css
--accent: #f5c518;        /* Primary brand color (gold) */
--accent-glow: rgba(245,197,24,0.15);
--accent-soft: rgba(245,197,24,0.08);
--blue: #6eb3ff;          /* Secondary accent */
```
For a light theme, also adjust:
```css
--black: #ffffff;         /* Background */
--surface: #f5f5f5;       /* Card backgrounds */
--text: #000000;          /* Text color */
```

#### Step 7: Verify Before Deploy
Run the checks in `PREFLIGHT.md`:
```bash
# Check all required files exist
for file in index.html 404.html robots.txt sitemap.xml _headers favicon.ico security.txt; do
  [ -f "$file" ] && echo "✓ $file" || echo "✗ $file MISSING"
done

# Check for leftover template references (searches all key terms from Step 2)
grep -i -r -E "scqcs|errerlabs|kmay89" . --include="*.html" --include="*.txt" --include="*.xml" --include="*.json"
```

#### Step 8: Deploy
Recommend Netlify (see `GETTING_STARTED.md`):
1. Push to GitHub
2. Connect repo to Netlify
3. Deploy settings: Build command: (none), Publish directory: `/`

### Preserving Functionality
When customizing, keep these for full functionality:
- All `data-sound="click|hover|drawer"` attributes (audio feedback)
- All `.reveal` and `.reveal-delay-*` classes (scroll animations)
- All `.card` and `.quantum-border` classes (visual effects)
- The `main.js` file (handles all interactions)
- The `_headers` file structure (security headers)
